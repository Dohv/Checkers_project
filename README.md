# Explanations of the technologies used
### I used many small functions to work off eachother instead of one big function 


#Approach taken
## First approach :
### i made arrays for all of the down right and left diagonal rows possible and tried to iterste through the arays to manipulate the game board, but that hit a brick wall because each div was always part of two arrays and i couldnt figure out how to solve some integral bugs
## Second approach :
### using querySelector i looped through all of the divs on the board and created a class kind of and broke down all of the data in each node and was able to manipulate the game board storing locations in an object as x and y coordinates.  From there it was all math adding and subtracting x and y coordinates to be able to move checkers piece and even jump over enemy pieces and remove them from the board.
